# New Builder Guide

## First steps
1) colocation: Locate your builder close to relays. The ultra sound relay is at OVH Roubaix (RBX), France.
2) submission format: Submit your bids using SSZ (not JSON) and GZIP compression.
3) submission frequency: The ultra sound relay does not have rate limitting which means you can increase the frequency at which you send blocks to us. Top builders make a few thousand submissions per block landed.
4) optimistic relaying: This is a massive relay-side optimisation where bids are processed optimistically, skipping simulation and saving on simulation latency. Almost all builders (22 of them!) have enabled optimistic relaying with the ultra sound relayâ€”it's hard to compete without. Here is an onboarding guide.
5) top bid websocket: To make competitive bids a builder needs to be aware of the auction's bid-to-beat, the top bid. We offer a websocket to efficiently keep track. Read more here: https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/docs/blob/main/top-bid-websocket.md
6) use http/2 or `Connection: keep-alive` if using http/1

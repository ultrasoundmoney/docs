# New Builder Guide

## First steps
1) colocation: Locate your builder close to relays. The ultra sound relay is at OVH Roubaix (RBX), France.
2) submission format: Submit your bids using SSZ (not JSON) and GZIP compression.
3) submission frequency: The ultra sound relay does not have rate limitting which means you can increase the frequency at which you send blocks to us. Top builders make a few thousand submissions per block landed.
4) optimistic relaying: This is a massive relay-side optimisation where bids are processed optimistically, skipping simulation and saving on simulation latency. Almost all builders (22 of them!) have enabled optimistic relaying with the ultra sound relayâ€”it's hard to compete without. Here is an onboarding guide.
5) top bid websocket: To make competitive bids a builder needs to be aware of the auction's bid-to-beat, the top bid. We offer a websocket to efficiently keep track. Read more here: https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/docs/blob/main/top-bid-websocket.md

### Data API
To see what adjustments were made, we offer an API.

https://relay.ultrasound.money/ultrasound/v1/data/adjustments?slot=7964405

The API expects a single query parameter, slot, indicating the slot you'd like to see the adjustments for. The earliest slot available in our production environment is `7869470`.

For a successful call the API returns a body with a field `data` with zero or more adjustments. Amounts are in Wei.
Example:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "adjusted_block_hash": "0x396fc66c421240af8a0b95598e7a2d1fc0e6ceafd18e4d128b96f918de7928e8",

    },
    {

      "submitted_value": "137825702388058300"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the event adjustments are requested for a slot which started less than 12 seconds ago, a 403 + JSON body with a single field `error` is returned, explaining the relay refuses to share data for slots that young.

Most bad requests will similarly have a JSON body with an `error` field. In rare error cases you may see no body, or a string body explaining the problem.

# New Builder Guide

## First steps
1) colocation: Locate your builder close to relays. The ultra sound relay is at OVH Roubaix (RBX), France.
2) submission format: Submit your bids using SSZ (not JSON) and GZIP compression.
3) submission frequency: The ultra sound relay does not have rate limitting which means you can increase the frequency at which you send blocks to us. Top builders make a few thousand submissions per block landed.
4) optimistic relaying: This is a massive relay-side optimisation where bids are processed optimistically, skipping simulation and saving on simulation latency. Almost all builders (22 of them!) have enabled optimistic relaying with the ultra sound relayâ€”it's hard to compete without. You can find a link to the on-boarding guide below.
5) top bid websocket: To make competitive bids a builder needs to be aware of the auction's bid-to-beat, the top bid. We offer a websocket to efficiently keep track. Read more here: https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/docs/blob/main/top-bid-websocket.md
6) use http/2 or `Connection: keep-alive` if using http/1

## URL
For staging / holesky use: `https://relay-builders-eu-holesky.ultrasound.money` or `https://relay-builders-us-holesky.ultrasound.money`.

For production / mainnet use: `https://relay-builders-eu.ultrasound.money` or `https://relay-builders-us.ultrasound.money`.

## Transaction Filtering

The ultra sound relay supports both transaction filtering and non-filtering proposers. A proposer's filtering preference is communicated in the `/relay/v1/builder/validators` response. Possible values are `none` for no filtering, and `ofac` for filtering according to [this list](https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/ofac-ethereum-addresses/blob/main/data.csv). By default, the endpoint only returns proposers with filtering set to `none`. To receive both filtering and non-filtering proposers in the lookahead, add the following query parameter: `?filtering=true`. A block containing filtered addresses in a filtered slot leads to a simulation failure. Below is an example response.

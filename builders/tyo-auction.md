# TYO auction

this is a brand new auction available in tokyo. this auction is closest for about \~20% of slots.

submitting to this auction requires paying to be whitelisted. as of writing 1600$/month, subject to change. feel free to reach out if this is interesting for you.

opting not to pay and submit to tyo does not mean your bids submitted elsewhere can't win in 20% of slots. they are only at a latency disadvantage, for details see: [bid-forwarding.md](bid-forwarding.md "mention")

co-location services are also available at this location. we'd set up a machine for you, add it to our private network, and hand you the SSH key while removing ours. fixed 400$/month + machine cost.

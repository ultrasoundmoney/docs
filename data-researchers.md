# data researchers

If you're interested in our data but not to receive bids as a proposer, or submit them as a builder, please use hosts:

```bash
# mainnet
https://relay-analytics.ultrasound.money
# hoodi
https://relay-analytics-hoodi.ultrasound.money
```

standard routes supported across relays are described at: [https://flashbots.github.io/relay-specs/#/Data](https://flashbots.github.io/relay-specs/#/Data) .

we are happy to provide more on request. some undocumented APIs are available for common needs of other relays and builders.

servers are in EU. no rate-limits are implied but try not to exceed 100Mbit/s or so.

as our relay operates in multiple geographies it may take some seconds to minutes for data to appear in the aggregated view this URL offers through `/relay/v1/data` and `/ultrasound/v1/data`.
